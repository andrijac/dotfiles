dotfiles

These are basically for my personal use, but feel free to check them and reuse some scripts.

Maybe the cleverest tricks belong to .bashrc, where three functions try to detect if GNU Screen
is running in order to show an "S" on the prompt (PS1), and show the return value of the previous
command if it is different than zero, or the history line if the retval is zero.
